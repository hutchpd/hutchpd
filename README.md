###  Hi, I’m Paul Hutchinson (@hutchpd)

-  Founder of [Findon Software](https://findonsoftware.com) – building better tools for humans (and occasionally tolerable software for machines).
-  Maker of things like [Kribik](https://kribik.com), a streamlined help desk system, and [EPGME](https://epgme.uk), a portfolio app for postgraduate medics.
-  Mildly interested in quantum physics – built my own [quantum superposition simulation library](https://github.com/hutchpd/QuantumSuperposition).
-  Always up for collaborations, side quests, or existential tech chats.  
-  Currently exploring the fuzzy edges between AI, education, and unrewarding DIY tasks.
